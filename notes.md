- Input from higher-order thalamic nuclei, like the POm, activates PV and VIP interneurons but suppresses SST neurons (Audette et al., 2018; Williams and Holtmaat, 2019).
- PV interneurons have a higher connection probability with TC axons, and the input is larger than that of the other interneurons, as well as excitatory neurons (Kloc and Maffei, 2014).
- [] studies examining amygdalocortical projections to a variety of cortical circuits: in the prefrontal cortex, the BLA projects directly onto PVC GABAergic neurons, which in turn exert feedforward inhibition onto nearby pyramidal cells (Dilgen et al., 2013; Cheriyan et al., 2016). Subsequent studies using optogenetic approaches to selectively stimulate BLA afferents demonstrated that BLA axons make synapses onto both PV and SST interneurons in the insular and prefrontal cortex (Haley et al., 2016; McGarry and Carter, 2016).
- For example, PV neurons preferentially express the genes for serotonin and opioid receptors, while SSTC cells express a wider variety of neuromodulatory receptor genes. Results showed that SST interneurons express genes for cholinergic, serotonergic, and oxytocinergic receptors, as well as those that bind substance P and orexin. VIP interneurons showed the highest and most diverse expression for neuromodulatory receptors, including those that bind serotonin, acetylcholine, neuropeptide Y, and catecholamines. Another study found that PV and SST inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex express neurotensin-1 receptors that are activated by neurotensin co-released by dopaminergic afferents in this cortical area (Petrie et al., 2005).


## Uncertainty Neuromodulation and Attention
Yu and Dayan 2005

- Acetylcholine: expected uncertainty
- Norepinephrine: unexpected uncertainty
- First, both (unexpected and expected uncertainty) should have the effect of suppressing top-down, expectation-driven information relative to bottom-up sensory-induced signals, as well as promoting learning about the context.
- Second, they should be selectively involved in tasks engaging just one or the other form of uncertainty.
- ACh and NE selectively suppress intracortical and feedback synaptic transmission, while sparing, or even boosting, thalamo-cortical processing. 
- ACh and NE also play a synergistic and permissive role in experience-dependent plasticity in the neocortex and the hippocampus (reviewed in Gu, 2002)
- Supressing one system only has more severe effects than suppressing both at the same time
