# Neuromodulators, interneurons and uncertainty

*„Neuromodulatory influences may be a key mechanistic link between behavioral state and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex.“* (Cardin 2019)
 
*„Several lines of recent evidence have pointed to inhibitory interneurons as a critical intersection point between neuromodulatory inputs and local cortical circuits“* (Cardin 2019)

*„There is evidence that multiple neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are co-released at the axon terminals of neurons (Trudeau, 2004; Sarter et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005)“* (Avery 2017)

## Achetylcholine (ACh)

### General

- originates in the basal forebrain (Avery 2017)
- cholinergic system affects essentially every system in the brain including sensory, prefrontal and limbic systems (Avery 2017)
- acetylcholine neurons in the basal forebrain receive functional input from dorsal raphe serotonin neurons (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Bengtson 2004)
- cholinergic neurons are activated during motor activity, such as running and licking, as well as in response to punishment (reviewed in Cardin 2019: Harrison 2016; Monosov 2015)

### Function

- has been suggested to be involved in memory consolidation (Hasselmo, 1999; Hasselmo and McGaughy, 2004), attention and expected uncertainty (reviewed in Avery 2017)
	- Memory consolidation: when ACh levels are low, recurrent connections are stronger and memories are retrieved, while when ACh levels are high sensory inputs are enhanced, recurrent inputs are reduced, and memory is encoded (reviewed in Avery 2017)
- Suggested that ACh enhances sensory input relative to recurrent inputs and feedback by suppression of top-down transmission (=> improvement of signal-to-noise ratio) (reviewed in Avery 2017: Disney et al., 2007; Goard and Dan, 2009; Chen N. et al., 2015)
- controls the speed of memory update (reviewed in Avery 2017: Doya, 2002, 2008)
- rapidly recruited by reward and punishment (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Hangya 2015)

### Relation to uncertainty

- ACh signals expected uncertainty (Yu and Dayan, 2005; classical view) and unexpected uncertainty (Marshall 2016)
	- human cholinergic basal forebrain activity has been shown to reflect an individual’s uncertainty about probabilistic cue-outcome relationships (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Iglesias 2015)
	- Pharmacologically manipulating ACh altered the degree to which participants’ perceptual beliefs modulated the preparation of their speeded responses to uncertain stimuli (Marshall 2016)
	- ACh balances the attribution of uncertainty within and between environmental contexts (Marshall 2016)
 	- Cholinergic receptor antagonists reduce outcome-contingency learning rates, subjects relied less strongly on newly arriving sensory information and more strongly on prior beliefs (reviewed in Bruckner 2022: Marshall 2016)
	- However, ACh antagonists also led to faster up-dating of volatility beliefs through higher volatility learning rates comparable to the effects of NE antagonists (reviewed in Bruckner 2022: Marshall 2016)
	- One potential explanation for this finding is that lower estimation uncertainty induced by ACh antagonists biases subjects to attribute PE more strongly to environmental changes instead of risk (reviewed in Bruckner 2022: Marshall 2016)
	- Magnitude of activation of cholinergic neurons is scaled by the unexpectedness of reinforcement signals (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Hangya 2015)
- ACh known to enhance bottom-up, feedforward thalamocortical transmission of sensory information relative to top-down, intracortical, and feedback processing (Gil et al., 1997; Hasselmo et al., 1996; Hsieh et al., 2000; Kimura et al., 1999; Kobayashi, 2000, reviewed in Yu and Dayan 2005 or Marshall 2016)
	- pharmacologically stimulating ACh augments bottom-up sensory signalling in human primary auditory cortex in response to auditory stimuli (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Moran 2013)

### Impact on Interneurons

- ACh has heterogeneous and diverse effects on subpopulations of PVs
	- In A1, PVs activated by ACh (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Kuchibhotla 2017, Nelson 2016)
	- PVs show complex and potentially region-specific sensitivity to ACh (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Kuchibhotla 2017, Kruglikov 2008)
	- PVs in barel cortex receive inputs from the Basal nucleus of Meynert, a source of cholinergic input (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Wall et al., 2016)
	- PV in M1 and S1 express cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
	- Half of PVs react to stimulation of cholinergic input (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Alitto and Dan, 2012) but responses are heterogeneous (Swanson in Maffei 2019)
	- One PV group was suppressed during locomotion in association with cholinergic input (reviewed in Cardin 2019: Garcia-Junco-Clemente 2019)
- ACh activates SOMs but effects range from mild to strong
	- Cholinergic inputs can enhance SOM neuron activity (reviewed in Urban-Ciecko 2016: Fanselow, 2008; Urban-Ciecko 2015; Chen 2015; Xiang 1998)
	- application of cholinergic agonists increases spontaneous activity of neocortical SST neurons (reviewed in Urban-Ciecko 2016: Fanselow, 2008; Chen 2015; Xiang 1998; Kawaguchi 1998)
	- In A1, ACh activated SOMs (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Kuchibhotla 2017, Nelson 2016) and has been shown that in M1 and S1 SOM expresses cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
	- SOMs in barrel cortex receive input from the Basal nucleus of Meynert (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Wall et al., 2016)
	- However, stimulation cholinergic input to the cortex modified rarely SST+ neurons (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Alitto and Dan, 2012)
- ACh strongly activates VIPs
	- Cholinergic inputs depolarise VIPs (reviewed in Wester 2014)
	- ACh resulted in increased Ca signal amplitude in the majority of VIPs (reviewed in Wester 2014) 
	- VIPs in barrel cortex receive input from cholinergic sources (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Wall et al., 2016)
	- VIPs in M1 and S1 express cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
	- In V1 & A1, cholinergic activity excites VIP-INs, which increases pyramidal spiking via disinhibition (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Fu 2016, Kuchibhotla 2017, Nelson 2016)
	- Stimulation of cholinergic input to the cortex modified all VIP+ neurons (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Alitto and Dan, 2012)


## Dopamine (DA)

### General

- Dopamine originates in either the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) (Avery 2017)
- VTA and SNc are strongly influenced by the striatum and subcortical structures such as the lateral habenula and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (Avery 2017)
- Dopamine neurons, in turn, send projections to the striatum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the “feedback” nature of this circuit (Avery 2017)

### Function

- In general, dopamine has been linked to reward, saliency, uncertainty and invigoration (Avery 2017)
	- D2 receptors play a preferential role in behavior and reward processing, whereas D1-expressing neurons are involved in working memory and attentional modulation of visual cortices (reviewed in Avery 2017: Noudoost and Moore, 2011; Gee et al., 2012; Puig and Miller, 2014)
	- DA may signal reward PE (reviewed in Avery 2017: Doya 2002, 2008)
	- DA neurons respond to any salient or novel input in the environment regardless of its reward value (reviewed in Avery 2017: Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010)
	- also been suggested that dopamine encodes the precision, the inverse of uncertainty, of alternative actions beliefs (reviewed in Avery 2017: Friston et al., 2012)
- Abnormalities in DA responses linked to disorders, including schizophrenia, attention and mood disorders, and Parkinson’s disease (reviewed in Avery 2017: Wise, 2004; Björklund and Dunnett, 2007; Schultz, 2007; Sillitoe and Vogel, 2008)
- DA depletion primarily impacts task performance and learning is left intact (reviewed in Avery 2017: Berridge and Robinson, 1998; Cannon and Palmiter, 2003; Berridge, 2012)

### Relation to uncertainty

- Diederen et al.: Under dopamine blockade, agents are less able to incorporate information about the reliability or precision of their predictions into the signals they use for learning
	- When agents could make more precise predictions (because the environment is stable), unexpected outcomes elicited stronger error signals — leading to more rapid belief updating AWAY from the prior rather than inferences biased towards it!
- DA depletion impairs adaptive reactions to unexpected events occurring within a broadly predictable context (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Bestmann 2014)
- Distinctions have also been made between D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptor subtypes in regulating adaptive responses to unexpected stimuli (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Bestmann 2014)
- no evidence that DA receptor antagonism influenced participants’ reactions to low-level sensory PE (Marshall 2016)
- manipulating DA altered the degree to which participants’ perceptual beliefs modulated the preparation of their speeded responses to uncertain stimuli (Marshall 2016)
- Parkinson’s disease patients with DA dysfunction have an impaired capacity to switch from naming digits to letters when both types of stimuli are presented simultaneously, even when the task shift is explicitly cued (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Cools 2001)

### Impact on interneurons

- Effect of DA on PV neurons moderate (in comparison to other INs DA has biggest impact seemingly, by judging the subset of papers I looked at)
	- DA enhances the excitability of fast-spiking INs (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Gorelova), while still depressing GABA release through direct inactivation of presynaptic terminals (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Tritsch 2012)
- SOM and VIP: could not find strong statements


## Serotonin

### General

- originate in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem, extend to almost all forebrain areas (Barnes and Sharp, 1999), including the cortex, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala (reviewed in Avery 2017: Harvey, 2003; Meneses and Perez- Garcia, 2007)
- Sertonin receptor activation can induce short-term changes in excitability (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Andrade, 2011; Celada 2013) as well as long-lasting synaptic plasticity (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Lesch 2012)
- Excitation of serotonin neurons enhanced learning rates (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Iigaya 2018)

### Function

- Generally, involved in impulsivity & punishment, reward and cost assessment, harm aversion, stress & anxiety (reviewed in Avery 2017: Millan, 2003; Jasinska et al., 2012; Asher et al., 2013; Heisler et al., 1998; Weisstaub et al., 2006), withdrawal
- Observations suggest two possible complementary contributions of serotonin neurons to behavioral flexibility: (1) to facilitate the learning of new associations and (2) to directly inhibit responses which are no longer appropriate (Matias 2017)
- Impairments to the serotonergic system have been linked to anxiety disorders and depression (reviewed in Avery 2017: Craske and Stein, 2016), as well as Parkinson’s disease (reviewed in Avery 2017: Bédard et al., 2011)
- Relation to RL
	- serotonin controls the discounting of reward prediction (reviewed in Avery 2017: Doya, 2002, 2008)
	- Has been confirmed in rodent and human experiments (reviewed in Avery 2017: Tanaka et al., 2007; Miyazaki et al., 2011)
	- higher serotonin firing activity causes a rat to wait longer for upcoming rewards, as predicted by temporal discounting (reviewed in Avery 2017: Miyazaki et al., 2011)

### Relation to uncertainty

- Modulates flexible behavior in changing environments (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Matias 2017; Clarke 2004 & 2007, Iigaya 2018)
- Activity of half of serotonin neurons correlate with „expected uncertainty“ on long time scales and „unexpected uncertainty“ at the time of outcome (Grossman 2022)
	- While some individual neurons had significant correlations for both forms of uncertainty, most only correlated with one, suggesting that the computation is performed across the population (Grossman 2022)
	- „Thus, the nervous system may maintain running estimates of two forms of uncertainty that generalize across behavioral tasks“ (Grossman 2022)
- serotonin neurons showed an increase in activity in response to positive and negative RPEs, and showed a larger response for the larger magnitude RPE (Matias 2017)
	- Serotonin neurons resembled an ‘unsigned RPE’ with respect to rewards and reward omissions, but they diverged from this model for air puff responses (Matias 2017)
	- Hypothesis: serotonin neurons might report errors of control rather than errors of prediction. Under this hypothesis, an aversive outcome such as the air puff continues to generate a response in serotonin neurons because the organism has not managed to control this aspect of its environment (Matias 2017)
- Deficits in serotonin, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex, disturb adaptation to changes in the required action for a given cue (reversal learning) by making the subjects more likely to stick to prelearned behaviors (Clarke 2004)
- Animals are still capable of adapting their behavior but do so more slowly in serotonin axon lesions (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Clarke 2004 & 2007), or reversible inactivation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Matias 2017)

### Impact on interneurons

- PV neurons are most likely influenced by serotonin
	- preferentially express the genes for serotonin and opioid receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
- SOM neurons are most likely influenced by serotonin
	- SOM neurons express genes for serotonergic receptors
	- Given that neuromodulators that reduce SOM-neuron activity have not yet been identified (Urban-Ciecko 2016), serotonin most likely increases SOM activity
- VIP neurons may be modified most strongly (in comparison to PV and SOM)
	- They are target of serotonergic inputs (reviewed in Wester 2014)
	- Express the ionotropic serotonin 5-HT3A receptor (Hattori 2017, Swanson in Maffei 2019)
	- serotonin induced fast membrane potential depolarizations (Isabelle Férézou 2002 J Neurosci)


## Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine (NA/NE)

### General
 
- With the exception of the basal ganglia, noradrenergic neurons, which originate in the locus coeruleus (LC), project to nearly every cortical and subcortical region (reviewed in Avery 2017: Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003)
- norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus receives functional input from dorsal raphe serotonin neurons (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Szabo 2001)

### Function

- Generally, involved in exploration vs. exploitation, network reset, unexpected uncertainty (Avery 2017)
- Two theories of noradrenergic function:
	1. The “adaptive gain theory” suggests that the noradrenergic system mediates the switch between exploration and exploitation behaviors (reviewed in Avery 2017: Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005)
	2. The “network reset” theory, on the other hand, suggests that the noradrenergic system is critical for functional reorganization of cortical activity when environmental contingencies change to allow for behavioral adaptation (reviewed in Avery 2017: Bouret and Sara, 2005)
- Suggested that exploration and exploitation modes are mediated by tonic and phasic LC activity (reviewed in Avery 2017: Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005)
	- High phasic and low tonic activity is indicative of an exploitive phase in which an animal is task engaged
	- High tonic modes, however, put the animal into a highly distractible state, allowing them to explore the state space

### Relation to uncertainty

- Jordan 2022: „LC responds to many different events, including unexpected task outcomes (Bouret and Sara, 2004; Breton-Provencher et al., 2022), novelty (Takeuchi et al., 2016; Vankov et al., 1995), and unexpected sensory stimuli in general (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981; Deitcher et al., 2019; Foote et al., 1980; Hervé-Minvielle and Sara, 1995)“
- Jordan 2022: „In zebrafish, noradrenergic neurons increase their activity during the prolonged visuomotor mismatches of failed swim attempts to drive ‘giving up’ behavior (Mu et al., 2019)“
- neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary source of cortical NA, show strong responses to unexpected environmental changes (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Sara 1991, Yu and Dayan 2005)
- Increasing NA in rodents enhances bottom-up, thalamo-sensory processing (Hasselmo 1997; Kobayashi 2000) relative to top-down, intracortical, and feedback processing (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Gil 1997; Dayan 2006)
	- Propranolol increases effects of expectations on behaviour (Lawson 2021) => NA decreases effects of expectations on behavior (that is, NA should be higher when environment is very volatile)
	- Across primary sensory cortices, NE selectively suppresses intracortical and feedback synaptic transmission, while sparing, or even boosting, thalamo-cortical processing (Gil et al., 1997; Hasselmo et al., 1996; Hsieh et al., 2000; Kimura et al., 1999; Kobayashi, 2000)
- NA influences learning of uncertain events arising from unexpected changes in the environment (Marshall 2016)
- NA is thought to offer an interrupt signal when volatility uncertainty arises between contexts (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Bouret 2005)
	- Propranolol reduces volatility-linked learning (Lawson 2021) => that is, new sensory input does not quickly lead to updating the belief system
	- Attenuating effect of NA eliminated effect of PE and volatility on pupil size, consistent with slower belief updating (Lawson 2021)
- May regulate and gate plasticity in the cortex (mentioned in Jordan 2022: Choi et al., 2005; He et al., 2015; Seol et al., 2007)
- Joram 2022: „Prevalent idea is that noradrenaline is a mediator of gain modulation in the cortex (Ferguson and Cardin, 2020), including the gain increase in V1 during locomotion (Polack et al., 2013)“


### Impact on interneurons

- PV may be depolarised by NA
	- NA depolarises fast-spiking (putative PV+) interneurons  (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Kawaguchi and Shindou, 1998)
	- A subpopulation of PV interneurons in sensory cortex increases activity with arousal in association with noradrenergic input (reviewed in Cardin 2019: Garcia-Junco-Clemente 2019)
- SOM are enhanced/activated by NA
	- noradrenergic inputs can enhance SST-neuron activity (reviewed in Urban-Ciecko 2016: Fanselow, 2008; Urban-Ciecko 2015; Chen 2015; Xiang 1998)
	- noradrenergic agonists increases spontaneous activity of neocortical SST neurons (reviewed in Urban-Ciecko 2016: Fanselow, 2008; Chen 2015; Xiang 1998; Kawaguchi 1998)
	- In V1, noradrenergic projections have been shown to connect to SOM neurons (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Paspalas 1999)
	- In the rat frontal cortex, noradrenaline depolarizes and drives SST (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Kawaguchi and Shindou, 1998)
- VIP seemingly target for NA (at least partly)
	- In V1, noradrenergic projections have been shown to connect to VIP neurons (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Paspalas 1999)

## Short summary on literature research

- ACh:
	- Classical view, that is, ACh signals expected uncertainty, is supported by literature
	- However, in one study, it has also been shown to lead to faster updating of volatility beliefs comparable to the effects of NE antagonists (which is related ti unexpected uncertainty)
	- Pretty much all VIP neurons show strong activation upon ACh, while PV neurons show heterogeneous response and SOM neurons show mild to moderate and/or rare responses
- DA:
	- DA depletion seems to impair incorporating uncertainty/precision into updating predictions and impairs reactions to unexpected events occurring within a predictable context
	- DA neurons increase activity of positive PE and decrease activity to negative PE 
	- From all INs, PVs are the most likely target
- Serotonin:
	- In one study, activity of half the serotonin neurons correlated with „expected uncertainty“ on long time scales and „unexpected uncertainty“ at the time of outcome
	- Serotonin neurons increase activity to both positive and negative PEs
	- Deficits in serotonin make subject more likely to stick to relearned behaviours (or at least takes longer to update)
	- While all INs are influenced by serotonin, VIPs are most strongly targeted and modulated by it (increase activity)
- NA:
	- NA higher when environment very volatile (NA neurons show strong responses to unexpected changes)
	- Increasing NA enhances bottom-up, relative to top-down (and antagonists increase effect of expectations on behavior and slower updating of belief system)
	- Responses of PV and SOM neurons may be more significant than of VIP neurons
	- Yon 2021b: Either NA selectively disrupts signalling of PE => slower belief update or it more generally sets the balance between bottom-up and top-down
		- This can be disentangled by repeating the same interventions of Lawson 2021 in a more stable environment
		- If first hypothesis is correct then nothing should change because sneezy input is used anyways, if second hypothesis is correct, effect of expectations should also be enhanced
