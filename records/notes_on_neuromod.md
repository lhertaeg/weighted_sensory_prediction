# Neuromodulators, interneurons and uncertainty

*„Neuromodulatory influences may be a key mechanistic link between behavioral state and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex.“* (Cardin 2019)
 
*„Several lines of recent evidence have pointed to inhibitory interneurons as a critical intersection point between neuromodulatory inputs and local cortical circuits“* (Cardin 2019)

*„There is evidence that multiple neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are co-released at the axon terminals of neurons (Trudeau, 2004; Sarter et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005)“* (Avery 2017)

## Activation of Inhibitory Neurons and Their Recruitment in behaviour

- Input from higher-order thalamic nuclei, like the POm, activates PV and VIP interneurons but suppresses SST neurons (Audette et al., 2018; Williams and Holtmaat, 2019).
- PV interneurons have a higher connection probability with TC axons, and the input is larger than that of the other interneurons, as well as excitatory neurons (Kloc and Maffei, 2014).
- [] studies examining amygdalocortical projections to a variety of cortical circuits: in the prefrontal cortex, the BLA projects directly onto PVC GABAergic neurons, which in turn exert feedforward inhibition onto nearby pyramidal cells (Dilgen et al., 2013; Cheriyan et al., 2016). Subsequent studies using optogenetic approaches to selectively stimulate BLA afferents demonstrated that BLA axons make synapses onto both PV and SST interneurons in the insular and prefrontal cortex (Haley et al., 2016; McGarry and Carter, 2016).
- For example, PV neurons preferentially express the genes for serotonin and opioid receptors, while SSTC cells express a wider variety of neuromodulatory receptor genes. Results showed that SST interneurons express genes for cholinergic, serotonergic, and oxytocinergic receptors, as well as those that bind substance P and orexin. VIP interneurons showed the highest and most diverse expression for neuromodulatory receptors, including those that bind serotonin, acetylcholine, neuropeptide Y, and catecholamines. Another study found that PV and SST inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex express neurotensin-1 receptors that are activated by neurotensin co-released by dopaminergic afferents in this cortical area (Petrie et al., 2005).


## Uncertainty Neuromodulation and Attention
Yu and Dayan 2005

- Acetylcholine: expected uncertainty
- Norepinephrine: unexpected uncertainty
- First, both (unexpected and expected uncertainty) should have the effect of suppressing top-down, expectation-driven information relative to bottom-up sensory-induced signals, as well as promoting learning about the context.
- Second, they should be selectively involved in tasks engaging just one or the other form of uncertainty.
- ACh and NE selectively suppress intracortical and feedback synaptic transmission, while sparing, or even boosting, thalamo-cortical processing. 
- ACh and NE also play a synergistic and permissive role in experience-dependent plasticity in the neocortex and the hippocampus (reviewed in Gu, 2002)
- Supressing one system only has more severe effects than suppressing both at the same time

- Propranolol (a common anxiolytic medication that blocks noradrenaline) increases the effects of expectations on behavior 
- Propranolol reduces volatility-linked learning 
- Propranolol reduces the impact of prediction errors and volatility on pupil size 
- Both unexpectedness and noise slowed down reaction times, but propranolol augmented the interaction between these main effects such that behavior was influenced more by prior expectations when uncertainty was high 
- Attenuating the global effects of NA also eliminated the phasic effects of prediction error and volatility on pupil size, consistent with slower belief updating 
- The neuromodulator noradrenaline (NA) has been shown to play a key role in detecting environmental change to facilitate learning. For example, increasing NA in rodents enhances bottom-up, thalamo-sensory process
- In contrast, NA blockade has been shown to impair, reversal learning and cognitive flexibility in non-human animals
- These results indicate that propranolol slows learning about cue-outcome contingencies and may produce a modest reduction in estimated volatility. 
- under propranolol, participants are less able to track the changing probabilities throughout the task 


## Yon 2021

- A long-standing hypothesis suggests that our brain uses specific neuromodulators to achieve this delicate weighting, altering the synaptic gain afforded to top-down predictions and bottom-up evidence based on how precise they are estimated to be. Indeed, recent work by Rebecca Lawson and colleagues has combined drug interventions with computational modelling to test and support this conjecture. 
- One hypothesis suggests that, when we estimate our environment to be more volatile, noradrenergic neuromodulation increases the gain (signal-to-noise) of incoming signals. This has the effect of upweighting incoming information — enabling rapid learning about potential changes — while also downweighting the impact old expectations have on inferences, since predictions are less reliable in a world that changes often. 
- In line with this idea, the authors found that those who receive the drug rely more heavily on their expectations when making perceptual judgements and are slower to update these predictions in the face of new evidence
- under dopamine blockade — agents are less able to incorporate information about the reliability or precision of their predictions into the signals they use for learning. 
- In the sensory prediction case, noradrenaline appears to encode the reliability of predictions — and more precise predictions lead to slower learning and a stronger reliance on expectations when making perceptual decisions. In the reward prediction case, however, dopamine also appeared to play a key role in enabling agents to track the reliability of the environment. When agents could make more precise predictions, unexpected outcomes elicited stronger error signals — leading to more rapid belief updating away from the prior rather than inferences biased towards it.
