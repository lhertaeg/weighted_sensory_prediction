# Neuromodulators, interneurons and uncertainty

*„Neuromodulatory influences may be a key mechanistic link between behavioral state and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex.“* (Cardin 2019)
 
*„Several lines of recent evidence have pointed to inhibitory interneurons as a critical intersection point between neuromodulatory inputs and local cortical circuits“* (Cardin 2019)

*„There is evidence that multiple neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are co-released at the axon terminals of neurons (Trudeau, 2004; Sarter et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005)“* (Avery 2017)

## Achetylcholine (ACh)

### General

- originates in the basal forebrain (Avery 2017)
- cholinergic system affects essentially every system in the brain including sensory, prefrontal and limbic systems (Avery 2017)
- acetylcholine neurons in the basal forebrain receive functional input from dorsal raphe serotonin neurons (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Bengtson 2004)
- cholinergic neurons are activated during motor activity, such as running and licking, as well as in response to punishment (reviewed in Cardin 2019: Harrison 2016; Monosov 2015)

### Function

- has been suggested to be involved in memory consolidation (Hasselmo, 1999; Hasselmo and McGaughy, 2004), attention and expected uncertainty (reviewed in Avery 2017)
	- Memory consolidation: when ACh levels are low, recurrent connections are stronger and memories are retrieved, while when ACh levels are high sensory inputs are enhanced, recurrent inputs are reduced, and memory is encoded (reviewed in Avery 2017)
- Suggested that ACh enhances sensory input relative to recurrent inputs and feedback by suppression of top-down transmission (=> improvement of signal-to-noise ratio) (reviewed in Avery 2017: Disney et al., 2007; Goard and Dan, 2009; Chen N. et al., 2015)
- controls the speed of memory update (reviewed in Avery 2017: Doya, 2002, 2008)
- rapidly recruited by reward and punishment (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Hangya 2015)
