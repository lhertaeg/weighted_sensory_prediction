# Neuromodulators, interneurons and uncertainty

*„Neuromodulatory influences may be a key mechanistic link between behavioral state and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex.“* (Cardin 2019)
 
*„Several lines of recent evidence have pointed to inhibitory interneurons as a critical intersection point between neuromodulatory inputs and local cortical circuits“* (Cardin 2019)

*„There is evidence that multiple neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are co-released at the axon terminals of neurons (Trudeau, 2004; Sarter et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005)“* (Avery 2017)

## Achetylcholine (ACh)

### General

- originates in the basal forebrain (Avery 2017)
- cholinergic system affects essentially every system in the brain including sensory, prefrontal and limbic systems (Avery 2017)
- acetylcholine neurons in the basal forebrain receive functional input from dorsal raphe serotonin neurons (reviewed in Grossman 2022: Bengtson 2004)
- cholinergic neurons are activated during motor activity, such as running and licking, as well as in response to punishment (reviewed in Cardin 2019: Harrison 2016; Monosov 2015)

### Function

- has been suggested to be involved in memory consolidation (Hasselmo, 1999; Hasselmo and McGaughy, 2004), attention and expected uncertainty (reviewed in Avery 2017)
	- Memory consolidation: when ACh levels are low, recurrent connections are stronger and memories are retrieved, while when ACh levels are high sensory inputs are enhanced, recurrent inputs are reduced, and memory is encoded (reviewed in Avery 2017)
- Suggested that ACh enhances sensory input relative to recurrent inputs and feedback by suppression of top-down transmission (=> improvement of signal-to-noise ratio) (reviewed in Avery 2017: Disney et al., 2007; Goard and Dan, 2009; Chen N. et al., 2015)
- controls the speed of memory update (reviewed in Avery 2017: Doya, 2002, 2008)
- rapidly recruited by reward and punishment (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Hangya 2015)

### Relation to uncertainty

- ACh signals expected uncertainty (Yu and Dayan, 2005; classical view) and unexpected uncertainty (Marshall 2016)
	- human cholinergic basal forebrain activity has been shown to reflect an individual’s uncertainty about probabilistic cue-outcome relationships (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Iglesias 2015)
	- Pharmacologically manipulating ACh altered the degree to which participants’ perceptual beliefs modulated the preparation of their speeded responses to uncertain stimuli (Marshall 2016)
	- ACh balances the attribution of uncertainty within and between environmental contexts (Marshall 2016)
 	- Cholinergic receptor antagonists reduce outcome-contingency learning rates, subjects relied less strongly on newly arriving sensory information and more strongly on prior beliefs (reviewed in Bruckner 2022: Marshall 2016)
	- However, ACh antagonists also led to faster up-dating of volatility beliefs through higher volatility learning rates comparable to the effects of NE antagonists (reviewed in Bruckner 2022: Marshall 2016)
	- One potential explanation for this finding is that lower estimation uncertainty induced by ACh antagonists biases subjects to attribute PE more strongly to environmental changes instead of risk (reviewed in Bruckner 2022: Marshall 2016)
	- Magnitude of activation of cholinergic neurons is scaled by the unexpectedness of reinforcement signals (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Hangya 2015)
- ACh known to enhance bottom-up, feedforward thalamocortical transmission of sensory information relative to top-down, intracortical, and feedback processing (Gil et al., 1997; Hasselmo et al., 1996; Hsieh et al., 2000; Kimura et al., 1999; Kobayashi, 2000, reviewed in Yu and Dayan 2005 or Marshall 2016)
	- pharmacologically stimulating ACh augments bottom-up sensory signalling in human primary auditory cortex in response to auditory stimuli (reviewed in Marshall 2016: Moran 2013)

### Impact on Interneurons

- ACh has heterogeneous and diverse effects on subpopulations of PVs
	- In A1, PVs activated by ACh (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Kuchibhotla 2017, Nelson 2016)
	- PVs show complex and potentially region-specific sensitivity to ACh (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Kuchibhotla 2017, Kruglikov 2008)
	- PVs in barel cortex receive inputs from the Basal nucleus of Meynert, a source of cholinergic input (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Wall et al., 2016)
	- PV in M1 and S1 express cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
	- Half of PVs react to stimulation of cholinergic input (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Alitto and Dan, 2012) but responses are heterogeneous (Swanson in Maffei 2019)
	- One PV group was suppressed during locomotion in association with cholinergic input (reviewed in Cardin 2019: Garcia-Junco-Clemente 2019)
- ACh activates SOMs but effects range from mild to strong
	- Cholinergic inputs can enhance SOM neuron activity (reviewed in Urban-Ciecko 2016: Fanselow, 2008; Urban-Ciecko 2015; Chen 2015; Xiang 1998)
	- application of cholinergic agonists increases spontaneous activity of neocortical SST neurons (reviewed in Urban-Ciecko 2016: Fanselow, 2008; Chen 2015; Xiang 1998; Kawaguchi 1998)
	- In A1, ACh activated SOMs (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Kuchibhotla 2017, Nelson 2016) and has been shown that in M1 and S1 SOM expresses cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
	- SOMs in barrel cortex receive input from the Basal nucleus of Meynert (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Wall et al., 2016)
	- However, stimulation cholinergic input to the cortex modified rarely SST+ neurons (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Alitto and Dan, 2012)
- ACh strongly activates VIPs
	- Cholinergic inputs depolarise VIPs (reviewed in Wester 2014)
	- ACh resulted in increased Ca signal amplitude in the majority of VIPs (reviewed in Wester 2014) 
	- VIPs in barrel cortex receive input from cholinergic sources (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Wall et al., 2016)
	- VIPs in M1 and S1 express cholinergic receptors (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Paul et al., 2017)
	- In V1 & A1, cholinergic activity excites VIP-INs, which increases pyramidal spiking via disinhibition (reviewed in Hattori 2017: Fu 2016, Kuchibhotla 2017, Nelson 2016)
	- Stimulation of cholinergic input to the cortex modified all VIP+ neurons (reviewed in Swanson in Maffei 2019: Alitto and Dan, 2012)
