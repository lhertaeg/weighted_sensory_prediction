# ToDo 

I list here the obvious next steps. The lists are not exhaustive ofc.


## Simulations

- run perturbation experiments in different mean-field networks (INs perturbed in both PE circuits equally or only in one of them)
- add behavioural task (for instance, contraction bias?)

- run experiments in "large-scale" networks to check whether the assumptions we have to make can be relaxed when deviations emerge un-coordinated in the network (and therefore can balance out)
- run experiments that summarise under which conditions the weighting does break down
- run experiments in which the perturbation target is the dendrites
- run experiments in which the input regime changes not only with respect to the variance but also the mean
- ...


## Theory

- compare with maths of Bayes factor surprise (Liakoni paper)
- derive an expression of how fast a transition from one input regime to the next takes place 
- how can the connectivity needed be learned?
- ...


## Literature

- study literature on neuromodulators, how they affect 1) different interneuron types and 2) update of belief system etc.
- neural implementation of Kalman filter
- ...


## Figures

- none of the figures is done yet
- Figure 1: Illustration of an intuitive example in which weighting is important
- SI figure on a comparison between Kalman filter and network?
- ...


## Writing
